⚙️ How It Works
📌 Step 1: Data Collection

The dataset Mall_Customers.csv contains details like Age, Gender, Income, and Spending Score.
📌 Step 2: Data Preprocessing

Cleans missing values and scales data for better clustering results.
📌 Step 3: Applying K-Means Clustering

The K-Means algorithm groups customers into different clusters.
📌 Step 4: Visualization & Insights

The clusters are plotted to analyze customer behavior visually.
📊 Results
🟢 Cluster 1: High-income, high-spending customers (Premium Shoppers)
🔵 Cluster 2: High-income, low-spending customers (Potential Buyers)
🟡 Cluster 3: Low-income, high-spending customers (Impulse Buyers)
🟠 Cluster 4: Low-income, low-spending customers (Budget Shoppers)

📌 These insights help businesses tailor marketing campaigns effectively! 🎯
