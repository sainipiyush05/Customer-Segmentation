Introduction

In this project, we use unsupervised learning techniques to cluster customers into distinct segments. By analyzing customer data, businesses can better understand their audience and create tailored strategies for different groups.

The model leverages K-Means clustering, which is widely used for customer segmentation due to its efficiency and simplicity.

Features

Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, scales features, and prepares data for analysis.

K-Means Clustering: Groups customers based on similarities.

Cluster Visualization: Visualizes clusters to understand customer behavior patterns.
Interactive Analysis: Helps identify actionable insights for targeted marketing campaigns.

Technologies Used

This project uses the following tools and technologies:

Programming Language: Python

Data Analysis:

pandas for data manipulation
numpy for numerical computations

Visualization:

matplotlib and seaborn for graphical analysis

Machine Learning: scikit-learn for clustering and preprocessing

How It Works

Data Collection and Preprocessing:

The notebook starts by importing the required libraries and loading the dataset.
Data cleaning, handling missing values, and feature scaling are performed.

Clustering:

The K-Means algorithm is applied to divide customers into clusters based on attributes such as spending patterns, demographic data, etc.

Visualization:

Clusters are visualized using scatter plots and other graphical techniques to understand customer segments.

Results

Cluster Insights:
Customers are grouped based on similarities in their purchasing habits or other relevant metrics.

Visualizations:
Scatter plots and heatmaps display relationships and clusters for actionable insights.

For example:

Cluster 1: High spenders who frequently purchase.
Cluster 2: Occasional buyers with low spending.
